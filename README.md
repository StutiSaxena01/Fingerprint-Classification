## Fingerprint-Classification
Implemented a fingerprint classification algorithm to classify fingerprints into one of the five categories:
whorl, right loop, left loop, arch, and tented arch.
The algorithm involves generating a feature vector derived from local ridge structures and feeding it to a
two-stage classifier.
Language Used: Python
